    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      I design and ship AI systems end-to-end: from data and infra to agents in production.
      My background spans biomedical engineering, classical ML, and modern LLM stacks.
      I care about failure modes, observability, and whether the thing still works
      three months after the launch hype is gone.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      Medium-term, I'm aiming at <span class="font-semibold">Head / Principal AI</span> responsibilities:
      owning architectures, mentoring engineers, and eventually spinning up deep-tech products
      around energy-efficient inference and autonomous tooling.
