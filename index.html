                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Henrique Pereira, an AI engineer with a background in biomedical engineering and a passion for using AI to tackle meaningful, real-world problems. My journey began with a fascination for data science and machine learning, where I discovered the immense potential of AI to bridge sectors from healthcare to business.</p>

                <p>With a strong foundation in both <b>Python</b> and <b>backend engineering</b>, I’ve developed solutions that integrate AI into everyday applications, from creating intelligent chat systems for business to building robust search engines that leverage data science and machine learning.</p>

                <p>Currently, I specialize in AI-driven solutions that help companies make better, data-driven decisions. My experience spans a variety of technologies including <b>TensorFlow</b>, <b>scikit-learn</b>, <b>SQL</b>, and <b>ElasticSearch</b>, as well as cloud platforms like <b>Azure</b>, <b>AWS</b>, and <b>Google Cloud Platform</b>. I have also worked with <b>NoSQL databases</b> and tools like <b>Docker</b> and <b>Spark</b> to streamline backend architectures and optimize workflows.</p>

                <p>In addition to my technical expertise, I'm driven by a vision to create intelligent solutions that improve both business performance and social outcomes. I believe in the power of technology to drive change and am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities that push the boundaries of what's possible in AI and data science.</p>

                <p>When I’m not developing AI models, you’ll find me traveling, learning about new cultures, and seeking fresh perspectives to inspire my work. Collaboration and diverse experiences fuel my creativity and problem-solving approach, making every project a chance to grow and make a real impact.</p>
